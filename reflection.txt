Autobiographical Game – “COLOR BALL”
Reflection – Pilar Liotta
My game, “COLOR BALL,” is an autobiographical piece about movement, identity, and collecting the different parts of myself as I’ve shifted between different places. Instead of a literal character, the protagonist is a small color-changing ball that represents how I’ve grown, migrated, and reassembled who I am over time.

The game includes a beginning, middle, and end. The opening scene is calm and simple, and once the player collects two glowing pieces, a plane animation plays to show my move from Argentina to the US. The next scene places the player on the Argentine flag, ending with the sun expanding across the screen. The final gameplay scene shows a split world: farmland and the city, which represents living in Alabama to my journey to NYC, with emojis and a chasing obstacle that represents challenges. After collecting two more pieces, the game fades into the ending scene, where the color-changing ball floats on a dark background with “thank you for playing.”

The interactions are simple on purpose: arrow keys move the ball, and SPACE restarts or begins the game. This makes it easy for someone else to pick up and understand. I used the structure we learned in class—scenes, collisions, objects, and timed animations—to organize the experience. The sketching and gray-box stage was especially helpful, because placing everything with basic shapes first made the final visuals much easier to add. I added new things in to the game that I didn't have from the start of the sketches but this made me feel more like it was an actual game than what I had before which was very abstract. 

Creating this game taught me how powerful simple mechanics can be when they are tied to personal meaning. I learned how to manage multiple scenes, create transitions, animate visuals, and balance clarity with storytelling. If I expanded it, I would add sound or more emotional cues, but overall I’m happy that the final game feels true to my story—abstract, playful, and personal! :)
